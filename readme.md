# A Latex Format for Paper and Presentations for UT Austin

**Notes:**

- **NONE OF THESE FILES ARE IN OFFICIAL.**
- **Colours and logos is as per UT Austin's braniding guidelines @ https://brand.utexas.edu/identity/ (I have tried my best to follow these but I don't take responsibility if everything is in line!)**

There are several math commands available in /include/symnbols which can be used directly in all tex files

There are three main .tex files:

- /fullPaper/fullPaper.tex : For final version of paper
- /initialPaper/initialPaper.tex : For intial version of paper
- /Presentation/UTPresentation.tex : For presentations using Beamer

All figures should be places in /figures folder.
